        "I built this forecasting model for time-series data using Python. Technically, I combined two powerful architectures: leveraging the Transformer to 'encode' the context and meaning within the data, and then using XGBoost to execute the final prediction decisions. This was a highly rewarding experience, helping me deepen my understanding of how Machine Learning can find patterns within complex datasets."
